# potato_psyllid_distribution_modeling
Analysis of potato psyllid museum specimens. Analysis for Ecological Applications (2017) "Museum specimen data reveal emergence of a plant disease may be linked to increases in the insect vector population"

Includes analysis using Bayesian occupancy model using nimble.

Subfolder "R_analyses" includes scripts specifying model and analyzing model output.

"R_functions" includes functions for custom nimble distribution and samplers, "nimble_definitions.R", and functions for extracting climate data from BCM climate rasters, "Extract_climate_data_functions.R".

"output" includes data set for analysis, "bactericera_data_nimble_occupancy.rds", detection data set on which the occupancy data set was based, "potato_psyllid_detection_dataset.rds", and a reference raster for making maps, "reference_raster.rds".
