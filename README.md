Analysis of potato psyllid museum specimens.
Includes analysis using Bayesian occupancy model using nimble.
Subfolder "R_analyses" includes scripts specifying model and analyzing model output.
"R_functions" includes functions for custom nimble distribution and samplers, "nimble_definitions.R", and functions for extracting climate data from BCM climate rasters, "Extract_climate_data_functions.R".
"output" includes data set for analysis, "bactericera_data_nimble_occupancy.rds", detection data set on which the occupancy data set was based, "potato_psyllid_detection_dataset.rds", and a reference raster for making maps, "reference_raster.rds".
